    <h2>A Place I Would Like to Visit</h2>
  
    <p class=place-description"> Given the choice, I would visit Greece. In Ancient times, this region was the envy 
  of the world, as its progressions in Philosophy, technology, and literature, were far 
  more advanced. Pythagoras, who was one of the first great mathematicians and philosophers. 
  Socrates, possibly the greatest philosophical thinker in the history of the world. 
  Plato, a great interpretor of Philosophy. These are just a few of the wonderful minds, 
  and legends, that emerged from the Greek culture. Greece also had the worlds largest library of both
  formal, and modern books (of that time), called the Library of Alexandria. For these reasons, I 
  want to see the nation that brought about a higher degree of knowledge and understanding to our world, today.</p>

    <h2>A Person I Admire <br> (past or present)</br></h2>   
  
    <p class= person-description"> I admire Amelia Earhart. She was a woman who displayed great strength and 
    patriotism in a world when (at the time) women rarely joined the military, nontheless,
    became legends. She is an inspiration for me, who wanted to become an officer in the 
    United States Air force to continue to move forward. She is the perfect example of
    strength, grace, and accomplishment, and I hope to, one day, be like her.</p>

    <!--There are many more people that I admire, and nearly all of them are war Vets. The 
    men and women who put their lives on the line, daily, to keep our country free, our 
    lives in this country secure, and preserve pride for the United States of America
    embedded in every American heart. These are my heroes.-->
